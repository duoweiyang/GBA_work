CS 2261: Milestone 2

Club Penguin’s Cart Surfer. There is no win state (even though it exists in main.c. 
It will be deleted or added later). 

So once you start the game by pressing enter, you will be greeted by a screen with flashing colors. Black means it’s a straight cave, red is turning right, and brown is turning left. If you crash 3 times, you lose. It’s not possible to continuously not crash for now (timing/animation issue that will be fixed) but it does work as proven by continuously holding onto the left or right arrow and not dying after 3 crashes.

It looks atrocious right now. Animation and art is in progress.
