CS 2261: Lab03

This is the GBA and colored-version of pong. 

The blue rectangle (left) is controlled with the A and B buttons (X and Z on the keyboard respectively). A moves this paddle up while B moves the paddle down.

The cyan rectangle (right) is controlled with the up and down arrow keys.

The game ends when the ball hits the bounds beyond the paddles. They will bounce off the top and bottom bounds, however.
