CS 2261: HW03

This is a varied variation of breakout. Instead of the same tidy rows each time you play, itâ€™s a random cluster. Press enter to start the game and enter during the game to pause.

The green paddle is controlled with the left and right arrow keys. Move it around to hit the red ball. 

The game ends when the ball hits the bound under the paddle.
